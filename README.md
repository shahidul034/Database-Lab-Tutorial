## Run the SQL command
> You can run SQL script by using the SQL command line. Besides, you can write your SQL command in a txt file and save the txt file as a SQL extension. Then, type the below command in the SQL command line.
```
start C:\Users\andromeda\Desktop\file.sql
```
## Oracle data types
Here is a link about the [oracle data types.](https://www.w3resource.com/oracle/oracle-data-types.php)
## Checking current user name
```
show user
```
## Checking the existing table in database.
```
select table_name from user_tables;
```

> It shows that we already have two tables in my database. So we need to drop those tables from the database for a fresh start. You can use this command to drop any table.
```
drop table department;
drop table course;
```
> First, we create the table "dept". Here, we can see that the primary key is dept_id because it uniquely identifies each row in the table.
```
Create table dept(
dept_id number(20),
dept_name varchar(30),

```
> When you observe the course table, they have another foreign key keyword referencing the dept_id from the "dept" table. We insert something in the course table. We must check whether this dept_id exists in the "dept" table.

# DDL
## Add column in the table
> We add a column in the dept table which is location.
> 
> Command structure: alter table **table_name** add **column_name** **column_definition**;

## Modify column definition in the table
> Command structure: alter table **table_name** modify **column_name** **column_definition**;
> 
> We modify the location data types char(20) to varchar(23);
```
alter table dept modify location varchar(23);
```
## Rename the column name
> Command structure: alter table **table_name** rename **column_name** to **column_name**;
```
alter table dept rename column location to location2;
```
## Drop the column from table
> Command structure: alter table **table_name** drop column **column_name**;

## Displaying table data using SELECT command
> Now, we find the rows from the "dept" table, which have 120 students using the select command.

```
select * from dept where no_of_student=120;
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shahidul034/database2k19/blob/main/DIAGRAM%20PIC/select.png)

> We find the dept_name, which course name is "database systems".
```
select * from dept where dept_id=(select dept_id from course where course_name='database systems');
```
![alt text](https://github.com/shahidul034/database2k19/blob/main/DIAGRAM%20PIC/subquery.png)

> Here, we add extra select command by adding an additional condition to find the dept_id in the "dept" table. This type of query is called a subquery.

## Updating the data in a table
> Now we want to update the value of the course name from the course table where course_no is "EEE1101";
> Command structure: update table_name set column_name=value where condition;
```
update course set course_name='Digital Electronics' where course_no='EEE1101';
```
## Deleting row from a table
> We add an extra row to perform the delete operation in the dept table.
```
insert into dept(dept_id,dept_name,faculty,no_of_student)values(12,'URP','CE',60);
```
> Now we delete the row from the dept table where dept_id is 12.

> Command structure: delete from  **table_name** where **condition**;
```
delete from  dept where dept_id=12;
```
## union, intersect, and except
```
select dept_name from dept where dept_name like 'E%' union select dept_name from dept where dept_name like '%M%';
```
## With clause
Calculates the maximum value of the no_of_student column from the dept table. The result of this subquery is a single row with a single column (val) containing the maximum value.
```
with max_student(val) as (select max(no_of_student) from dept)
select * from dept,max_student where dept.no_of_student=max_student.val;
```

## Aggregate function
We count how many row exist in dept table.
```
select count(*) from dept;
 ```
 We also give alias name to any output in select command.
 ```
select count(dept_name) as number_of_dept from dept;
 ```
We can count distinct department name in dept table.
 ```
select count(distinct dept_name) as number_of_dept from dept;
 ```
We can count average and total no. of students in dept table.
 ```
select avg(no_of_student) from dept;
select sum(no_of_student) from dept;
 ```
We can find max and min no. of students of any department from dept table.
 ```
 select max(no_of_student) from dept;
 select min(no_of_student) from dept;
```
## Group by and Having
> Find the average of student according to faculty.
```
select faculty,avg(no_of_student) from dept group by faculty;

```
![alt text](https://github.com/shahidul034/BookList_database-project/blob/master/DIAGRAM%20PIC/group%20by.png)

> Find the average of student according to faculty where average of student is greater than 60. 
 ```
 select faculty,avg(no_of_student) from dept group by faculty having avg(no_of_student)>60;
 ```
 ![alt text](https://github.com/shahidul034/BookList_database-project/blob/master/DIAGRAM%20PIC/having.png)
 
 ## Nested subquery
 > Find the department name where the “rosen”(author) book is taught.
```
 select dept_name from dept where dept_id=(select dept_id from course where course_no=(select course_no from relation where book_no=(select book_no from book where author='rosen')));
```
 ![alt text](https://github.com/shahidul034/database2k19/blob/main/DIAGRAM%20PIC/subquery2.png)
## Set Membership(AND, OR,NOT)
Find the rows where faculty is "EE" and "CSE" string exists in course_no.
```
select * from dept where faculty='EE' and dept_id in (select dept_id from course where course_no like '%CSE%')
```
## some/all/exists/unique
![alt text](https://github.com/shahidul034/database2k19/blob/main/DIAGRAM%20PIC/some.png)
![alt text](https://github.com/shahidul034/database2k19/blob/main/DIAGRAM%20PIC/all.png)
```
select * from book where book_no> some(select book_no from book where book_no>=14);
select * from book where book_no> all(select book_no from book where book_no>=14);
```
The exists construct returns the value true if the argument subquery is nonempty.
```
select * from course where year_semister>=11 and exists(select * from dept where faculty like '%EE%');
```

select dept_name,course_name from dept full outer join course using(dept_id);
select dept_name,course_name from dept left outer join course on dept.dept_id=course.dept_id;
```
## Views
View definition is not the same as creating a new relation by evaluating the query expression.

A view of dept without their faculty,no_of_student.
```
create view dept_details as select dept_id,dept_name from dept;

```
Find all course in the CSE department.
```
create view CSE_DEPT_COURSE as select course_name from course where dept_id=(select dept_id from dept where dept_name='CSE');
```
Views Defined Using Other Views
```
create view  custom as select * from dept_details where dept_id>=3;

## ARRAY with extend() and without extend() function 
The A_NAME.EXTEND() method is used to dynamically increase the size of the varray A_NAME at runtime by one element. When you use A_NAME.EXTEND(), you don't need to know the size of the varray in advance, and you can add elements to the varray as needed.

On the other hand, if you declare the varray with a fixed size and initialize it with values at the beginning, you can assign values to the elements of the varray using the varray_name(index) := value syntax, as shown in the previous example. However, if you try to assign a value to an index that is beyond the fixed size of the varray, you will get a PLS-00302: component 'index' must be declared error.

So the main difference between using and not using A_NAME.EXTEND() is that with A_NAME.EXTEND(), you can dynamically resize the varray as needed, while without it, the varray has a fixed size and you cannot add more elements than the declared size.

## Trigger
**Trigger body**

[for each row]  
[trigger_body] 
```

> This trigger is named "try" and is set to execute before each row is deleted from the "relation" table
> The REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n clause specifies that the trigger will reference the "old" values (i.e. the values before the deletion) as "o" and the "new" values (which do not exist in this case because it's a delete trigger) as "n".

> Inside the trigger, there are two delete statements. The first statement deletes any rows from the "book" table where the "book_no" matches the value of "o.book_no" (i.e. the book number of the row being deleted from "relation"). The second statement deletes any rows from the "course" table where the "course_no" matches the value of "o.course_no" (i.e. the course number of the row being deleted from "relation").
```

END;
/
```

> The trigger is set to fire after an update operation is performed on the "course" table.
> For each row being updated, the trigger fires and updates the "book_name" column in the "book" table with the new course name (:n.course_name) where the "book_no" is present in the "relation" table for the corresponding old course number (:o.course_no).

> The ":n.book_no" syntax refers to the "book_no" field in the newly inserted row (referenced as "n"). The "update" statement will modify the "book" table by incrementing the "course_offering" field by 1 for the row where the "book_no" matches the "book_no" of the newly inserted row.
